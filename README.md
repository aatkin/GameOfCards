GameOfCards
===========

A small game for playing cards. This is a game I've created in my pastime somewhere in 2013. It will feature
- [x] single player mode
- [] multiplayer mode with friends over the Internet
- [] easy-to-use GUI
- [] multiple card games

I've always been fond of learning card games, and creating them is especially awesome. Hopefully I can somewhere in the future convert this game to either Android and/or OpenGL ([three.js](http://threejs.org) maybe?).
